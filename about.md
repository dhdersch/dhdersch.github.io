I am a Software Engineer that recently discovered [Go](https://golang.org/) after a couple of years in the C# .NET world. I also dabble with Bash, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby. I write about interesting things along the way. I am also currently a part-time Computer Science graduate student at [Georgia Institute of Technology](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/).
