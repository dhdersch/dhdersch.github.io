Thank you for reading my initial post. This is my first time creating 
a webpage using Jekyll, so this post will primarily serve to test some of its features.

I intend to write about GoLang, so I'll test highlighting a Go snippet.

{% highlight go %}
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World!")
}
{% endhighlight %}

The above text should be a simple "Hello World" program written in Go. How does it look?
